# Br*k%n! D$M

Well it's finally happened. Do I really need to say more? I think we've all been waiting for something like this to happen for a very long time and now that it's actually happened I bet you can't even believe it. In fact, I don't think you can even accept the reality that you are being thrusted into. Fine FIne FINe, FINE, I'll tell you. Your instructors have lost their minds. Yeah that's right, they've lost it completely. Surprised? I'm not, fork and clone this repo and you'll see just how far they've fallen.

I'd like to tell you what happened but seeming as I'm one of the instructors my mind is very blurry. Last thing I remember was hopping on a boxcar to catch a trip to Miami. No no no, that wasn't it... what was it? Someone was saying something about Miami, or maybe it was about their Mami? Yeah, that might have been it. I think we may have been going to a party but that doesn't feel right because I've never been invited to a party before. Did I crash a party? I don't think so. 

Anyway so there I was on a subway train car headed to Grand Central Station, that's when we met Billy. Billy was insane. He stood six foot nine and was an easy 350. Long greased out black and brown hair down to his knees and a crumpled cigarette clinging from his lips like that "Hang In There Kitty" poster. 

It's all coming back now. Billy kidnapped us in burlap sacs, threw us over his shoulder and rode his Harley. We flopped onto his dungeon floor. It was there that he belched that his Computer Science project was due in two days. Billy demanded that we do it for him. We began to code, but we were so nervous we couldn't think straight. Sweating profusely the beads dribbled into our eyes and stung them. We couldn't see, and we couldn't think over his blasting of Alice in Chains. 

Still we continued to try. After 12 straight hours and bleeding fingers, Billy grunted that he'd let us go for 1 day as long as we promised to return with his completed work. He'd find us again. We vigorously nodded and then back in the sacs we went. We were spun, tumbled, and twirled, and finally 'safe'. 

Time is running out and the project needs to get complete NOW. PLEASE! I'm afraid of Billy! We need YOUR help! 

Here are the requirements: 
The page should look and behave exactly like [this](https://joinpursuit.github.io/brokenDomExercises/)

* Disemvowel that takes in a string and returns it without the vowels. Should work for both upper and lower case letters. 
* isPalindrome - should take in a string and display true or false depending on if the string is a palindrome. 
* Should list Billy's favorite numbers. 
* Should show the sum, average, and another list of the odd numbers from Billy's favorites. 
* Counter. Should show the number of times Click! has been clicked. Clicking on Reset! should reset the count to 0. 
* Shopping List - Billy should be able to add items to the list, and the input should clear after he adds them. 
* Kill button - should remove the button and display a victory message when the button is clicked with the dagger. 

Good luck, we're counting on you!
